          Croatia is an amazing country, with almost untouched nature,
          incredibly beautiful harbors and small islands. We are going on a
          7-day voyage on these islands! Bathing in the open sea, contemplation
          of the wonderful nature, green woods, sandy beaches and red tile roofs
          of ancient houses are waiting for you. We start from Pula and go
          through the islands of Krk, Hvar, Cres, Rab, Mljet and 10 more
          islands!

          flavor with hospitable people. The lovers of scuba diving will be
          surprised by the diverse marine world - there are sea urchins with
          unrealistically long needles, colorful fish, sea turtles and more.
