        <p class="technical-side__servise--text">We have 3 types of yachts of various capacities. When you apply for a tour, we book for you the appropriate number of sleeps on the yacht, and we determine the total number of yachts and their type depending on the number of tourists overall. If you are traveling with a large company of friends or family, you can book the entire vessel you like.</p>

        <p class="technical-side__servise--text">In the most minimal package, there is only the captain with you on the yacht, and many actions with the vessel, sail and ropes you perform by your own. Donâ€™t worry, the captain will teach you everything, and this can be a great start to your yachting experience. If you are still not ready to participate in such tasks and want just to bathe and sunbathe, you can choose the option captain+skipper or all-inclusive.</p>

        <p class="technical-side__servise--text">Some of our yachts are equipped for scuba diving and fishing. If you want to do these sports during any of the trips, be sure to inform our manager, and he will reserve a yacht for you with all the necessary equipment. In addition, don't forget about DAN - obligatory insurance for divers. Without it, we will be forced to refuse you to dive.</p>

        <p class="technical-side__servise--text">All our yachts are equipped with stabilizers, so you are unlikely to feel seasickness. All vessels pass the timely technical inspection, we have all the licenses and permits. Nevertheless, the sea is an element over which we have no power. In order to make your holiday cloudless, we ask you to comply with all orders of the crew, and act in accordance with the safety regulations.</p>
