              We have 3 types of yachts of various capacities. When you apply
              for a tour, we book for you the appropriate number of sleeps on
              the yacht, and we determine the total number of yachts and their
              type depending on the number of tourists overall. If you are
              traveling with a large company of friends or family, you can book
              the entire vessel you like.

              Some of our yachts are equipped for scuba diving and fishing. If
              you want to do these sports during any of the trips, be sure to
              inform our manager, and he will reserve a yacht for you with all
              the necessary equipment. In addition, don't forget about DAN -
              obligatory insurance for divers. Without it, we will be forced to
              refuse you to dive.

              In the most minimal package, there is only the captain with you on
              the yacht, and many actions with the vessel, sail and ropes you
              perform by your own. Don’t worry, the captain will teach you
              everything, and this can be a great start to your yachting
              experience. If you are still not ready to participate in such
              tasks and want just to bathe and sunbathe, you can choose the
              option captain+skipper or all-inclusive.
