          There's no need to pay the full price the day you book your yacht
          vacation. You can split the sum and pay in 3-5 instalments. You can
          discuss the options with our manager when booking the trip.

        <p class="payment-options__option-description">
          If you want to book the whole yacht, then do it in advance as usually,
          by the beginning of the season, there are only few cabins left on each
          yacht. So, we advice you make early booking, plus saving with the
          special offers.
